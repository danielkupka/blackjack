            <p>Of all the games found in a casino, blackjack is among the most popular, owing to its simple nature, low barrier to entry, and reputation as one of the few games with a low house edge. Blackjack, a card game against the dealer, revolves around the number 21: the dealer and players alike attempt to reach a hand value of 21 - or close to it - without going over, known as busting.</p>
            <p>When a player is able to hit 21 using any combination of cards, they have hit a blackjack, and automatically win. Unfortunately for blackjack enthusiasts out there, winning the game by scoring 21 outright is fairly rare - for players, we only see a blackjack about 10.4% of the time.</p>
            <p>Interesting enough, the most common final score for players is actually 20, just shy of the magic number. In fact, a player can expect to end with a score of 20 about 16.3% of the time. Although just short of a guaranteed win, 20 points will still win 70% of games and tie in another 18.5%, so being dealt two face cards isn’t anything to complain about.</p>
            <p>Here’s how often players end at every value:</p>

            <p>Blackjack, although a game of luck, involves very critical decisions: to say “hit me” or to “stand.” The decision can be easy: if you have a very low card total, you’ll almost always want to accept another; conversely, if you have a high total, another card is most likely to ruin your game. The tough decision making comes when players are sitting somewhere in the middle.</p>

            <p>As you might have noticed in our blackjack simulator, the strategy of most players is remarkably consistent: players universally say “hit me!” when they’re sitting at a value of 11 or less - since there is no card in the deck that could cause them to bust at that point. Meanwhile, not a single player with a hand value of 18 or higher ever accepted a card. Even if there was a chance a player with a hand of 18 could draw a 3 and win the game, they never wanted to risk it.</p>
            <p>The middleground we discussed earlier, where players really have to make a tough call on wether to stay or take another card, is therefore a hand value of 12-16: most players actually stay even when in this area, but there’s a sizeable group who are willing to risk it. So if you often found yourself clicking “Hit Me” with a hand value of 15 or 16, you might just consider yourself a risk taker! Of course, perhaps you’d think twice if your money was on the line...</p>
