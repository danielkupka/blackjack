        Of all the games found in a casino, blackjack is among the most popular,
        owing to its simple nature, low barrier to entry, and reputation as one
        of the few games with a low house edge. Blackjack, a card game against
        the dealer, revolves around the number <em>21</em>: the dealer and
        players alike attempt to reach a hand value of <em>21</em> – or close to
        it – without going over, known as busting.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a player is able to hit <em>21</em> using any combination of cards,
        they have hit a blackjack, and automatically win. Unfortunately for
        blackjack enthusiasts out there, winning the game by scoring
        <em>21</em> outright is fairly rare - for players, we only see a
        blackjack about 10.4% of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interesting enough, the most common final score for players is actually
        <em>20</em>, just shy of the magic number. In fact, a player can expect
        to end with a score of <em>20</em> about 16.3% of the time. Although
        just short of a guaranteed win, <em>20</em> points will still win 70% of
        games and tie in another 18.5%, so being dealt two face cards isn't
        anything to complain about.
      </p>
      <p>Here's how often players end at every value:</p>

        Blackjack, although a game of luck, involves very critical decisions: to
        say "hit me" or to "stand". The decision can be easy: if you have a very
        low card total, you'll almost always want to accept another; conversely,
        if you have a high total, another card is most likely to ruin your game.
        The tough decision making comes when players are sitting somewhere in
        the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you might have noticed in our blackjack simulator, the strategy of
        most players is remarkably consistent: players universally say "hit me!"
        when they're sitting at a value of <em>11</em> or less – since there is
        no card in the deck that could cause them to bust at that point.
        Meanwhile, not a single player with a hand value of <em>18</em> or
        higher ever accepted a card. Even if there was a chance a player with a
        hand of <em>18</em> could draw a <em>3</em> and win the game, they never
        wanted to risk it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The middleground we discussed earlier, where players really have to make
        a tough call on whether to stay or take another card, is therefore a
        hand value of <em>12</em> to <em>16</em>: most players actually stay
        even when in this area, but there's a sizable group who are willing to
        risk it. So if you often found yourself clicking "Hit Me" with a hand
        value of <em>15</em> or <em>16</em>, you might just consider yourself a
        risk taker! Of course, perhaps you'd think twice if your money was on
        the line...

        used in this article comes from Kaggle and was generated by code meant
        to replicate actual players. Each row represents a unique player in a
        game; every six rows represent a unique game, in which all artificial
        players shared a deck and dealer, which helps the card distribution
        represent that of an actual casino experience. Code used to analyze the
